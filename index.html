  <h3>Military Science Information</h3>
	<p>The Junior Reserve Officer Training Corp (J.R.O.T.C.) is a leadership program. JROTC is not a military readiship program, but a program meant to ready Cadets for life after highschool.</p>
	<p> Cadets in the program learn such things as responsibility, accountability, being a better writer, how to march, leadership, public speaking, and so much more!</p>
